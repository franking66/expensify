Expensify Take-Home Assignment: Design & Implementation

Abstract
This document outlines the design and implementation details of the Expensify take-home assignment.

Part I. Scope of The Assignment

1. Provided Infrastructure
   Four Ubuntu servers prebuilt with core OS images:

   Public IP        Internal IP
   35.90.45.219     172.30.0.162
   54.68.212.0      172.30.0.203
   18.237.177.17    172.30.0.51
   34.219.183.229   172.30.0.247

2. Objectives
Build a load-balanced and secure environment with the following specifications:

 1) Load Balancing:
      Implement any suitable balancing strategy (e.g., round robin, random, load-based).
      Ensure session stickiness is enabled (i.e., sticky sessions).
      The original client IP must be passed to the backend web servers.
      Forward TCP ports 60000â€“65000 on the load balancer to port 80 on the web servers.

 2) Monitoring:
      Deploy a Nagios server to monitor the full stack.
      Configure Nagios to issue alerts for both warnings and failures.

 3) User Management:
      Add a user named expensify.
      Grant sudo privileges.
      Set up authentication via SSH public key.

 4) Network Security:
      Configure a single public SSH access point (i.e., a jump server) for administrative access to all other instances.
      Disable or remove all unnecessary and unused ports.
